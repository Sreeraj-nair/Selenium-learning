# Introduction to Scrum 

## Scrum vs Waterfall 

Waterfall 

      - Plan 
        - Build 
            - Test 
               - Review 
                  - Deploy 
 
 Scrum is an implementation of Agile. 
 
  - Just enough planning 
  - Build what was planned
  - Test that small feature set 
  - Review 
  Potentially shippable product after every sprint. Every 
  
  | Sprint 1  | Sprint 2 |  Sprint 3 |
  | --------  | -------- |  -------  | 
  |   Plan    | Plan     |  Plan     |
  |   Build   | Build    |  Build    |
  |   Test    | Test     |  Test     |
  |   Review  | Review   |  Review   |
 
  Repeat the whole process. You result up in several incremental releases call Sprints. 
  
 ## 3 Roles 
 
 ### Product Owner - 
 Respinsible for defining the features that are required in the product. 
 
 ### Scrum Master - 
 Leader to the team, responsible for protecting the team and the process. Keeps the work going, setting up meetings 
 and so on. 
 
 ### Team - 
 Developers, Testers, Writers, Designers and everyone else involved in the project. 
 
 ## 3 Artifacts 
 
 ### 1. Product Backlog - 
 Prioritized list of features known as user stories that could go into the product. This list evolves and changes priority with every 
 sprint. 
 
 ### User Stories - 
 Describes a feature set that follows 
            As a ..."user"... 
            I need .... "something"... 
            So that ... "reason"...
 
 The product owner adds right amount of details to the user story so that team can estimate the size of the task. 
 
 ### 2. Sprint Backlog - 
 The highest priority user stories go into the sprint backlog and are committed to the next sprint. 
 
 ### 3. Burn down chart - 
 Shows the progress of sprint on the completion of tasks on the sprint backlog. This chart approaches 0 points as the work is completed. 
 
 ## 3 Ceremonies 

### 1. Sprint Planning 
Is the meeting where the product owner, scrum master and the team meets to discuss the user stories and estimate the relative sizes. 

### 2. Daily Scrum 
Is a brief standup meeting where the team discusses what they have completed since the previous meeting, things they are working on and 
anything that is blocked and needs help on. 

### 3. Sprint Retrospective or Review 
Demonstrates the completed work to the product owner. Discuss what they can do to improve the process going forward. 

Sprint is a 1 to 3 weeks time box. 

Product owner decides whether the product is ready to be shipped or if additional features needs to be included to ship the product.
