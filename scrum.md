# Introduction to Scrum 

## Scrum vs Waterfall 

Waterfall 

      - Plan 
        - Build 
            - Test 
               - Review 
                  - Deploy 
 
 Scrum is an implementation of Agile. 
 
  - Just enough planning 
  - Build what was planned
  - Test that small feature set 
  - Review 
  Ship the potentially shippable product. 
  
  | Sprint 1  | Sprint 2 |  Sprint 3 |
  | --------  | -------- |  -------  | 
  |   Plan    | Plan     |  Plan     |
  |   Build   | Build    |  Build    |
  |   Test    | Test     |  Test     |
  |   Review  | Review   |  Review   |
 
  
  
  Repeat the whole process. You result up in several incremental releases call Sprints.
